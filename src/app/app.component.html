            Currently, Purdue doesn’t have a system for students, faculty, and
            the general public to rate their experience at dining courts, or to
            make informed decisions about where they wish to dine on campus
            based on real-time statistics of other users’ dining experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            PUrfect Dining utilizes a 3-button rating system to enable users,
            while exiting dining courts, to rate their dining experience on a
            scale of 1-3: Poor, Satisfactory, or Excellent, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>home page</strong> displays real time information about
            which dining courts are open, and which ones are closed. The ratings
            that you see beside them represent the average rating of the dining
            court for the current meal time.<br />
            Clicking a dining court's name on the home page will lead you to the
            <strong>individual dining court's page</strong>, which displays
            information about the respective dining court. This includes the
            average rating and the menu for the current meal time, the comments
            by users on the dining courts, and most importantly, the graph
            representing all ratings for the dining court for the current meal
            time.<br />
            Commenting is available for users who have created an account.
            Additionally, they also have the option of reporting a big/providing
            feedback using the feedback form that can be accessed on the
            settings page.<br />
